# Bots-Automation
Simple automation script using Selenium, for filling and searching text on a test website 

# To Run:
1.) Download the Bots-Automation 2.) run the automation.py on the terminal i.e. $ python3 automation.py

# NOTE
I am currently using a chromedriver.exe for windows, depending on your machine you would need to downlaod the chromedriver.exe from https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads and download the driver based on your OS. Make sure to put the "chromedriver.exe" in the same file with the automation.py
